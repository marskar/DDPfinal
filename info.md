# Welcome to LedgEx!
## Background 
LedgEx is short for Ledger Explorer. A ledger is a document that summarizes financial transactions for a set of accounts (my own non-expert definition). Ledgers can contain large amounts of data and are generally not formatted for easy analysis. The LedgEx application is designed to create tidy versions of ledgers that can be downloaded from and analyzed on its web-based user interface. 

## Source data example 
The dataset chosen for the app is QuickBooks General Ledger Report from the January 2017 [Data mining your general ledger with Excel](http://www.journalofaccountancy.com/issues/2017/jan/general-ledger-data-mining.html) article by J. Carlton Collins, published in the Journal of Accountancy. 

## Source code
Source code is available on the [GitHub](https://github.com/marskar/DDPfinal).

## Usage notes
### Plots tab
The Plots tab of main panel shows two bar charts and two pie charts. The bar charts show Credit or Debit values by month for the entire date range. The pie charts show proportions of Credit or Debit  values for an individual month.
### User controls
You can adjust threshold Credit and Debit values for the bar charts and the date range for the pie charts using the control panel located on the left side (sidebar) of the user interface. 
### Data tab
The cleaned dataset can be downloaded using the Data tab of the main panel.
